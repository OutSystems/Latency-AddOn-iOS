#LatencyWarning - OutSystems Latency Add-on v1.0

This Add-On **only works with OutSystems Servers** because it calls a specific service on OutSystems to measure the latency.

Helper addon that allows to:

- Measure Latency
- Warning the user if there is a slow connection

LatencyWarning add-on is constituted of three classes:

- [`LatencyWarning`]
- [`LatencyDetection`]

---

## Usage

### Importing files
1. Import source files into project:
  - LatencyWarning.m
  - LatencyWarning.h
  - LatencyDetection.m
  - LatencyDetection.h
2. Make sure the implementation files are added into "Compile Sources" of the desired target
4. That's it.

### Example

```objective-c

// ApplicationViewController.h
#import "LatencyWarning.h"

// rest of the header file...

@end
```

```objective-c
@implementation ApplicationViewController

-(void)viewDidLoad {
  //instantiate LatencyWarning
  LatencyWarning *latency = [[LatencyWarning alloc] initWithHostName:self.infrastructure.hostname andMainView:self.view];
}

@end
